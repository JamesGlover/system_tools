# system_tools

A collection of shell scripts and other tools for day-to-day usage

## Background

I'm expecting a replacement laptop later today,
so am attempting to gather together my various
customizations to make migration easier.

Feel free to grab anything which looks useful,
but unless you are me, its probably best not
to just use this outright.

## Installation

```bash
git@github.com:JamesGlover/system_tools.git
cd system_tools
./install.sh
```
